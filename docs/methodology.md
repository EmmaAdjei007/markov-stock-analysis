# Methodology

This project uses Markov chains to model stock price movements. Key steps include:
1. Fetching historical stock data.
2. Assigning states based on daily returns.
3. Building a transition matrix.
4. Simulating future price paths.
5. Backtesting the model.
6. Comparing multiple tickers.
